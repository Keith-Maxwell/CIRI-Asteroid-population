# Asteroid-population

School project as part of the CIRI at IPSA. 

The objective is to modelize the trajectory of an asteroid in the solar system. At the term of the project, we should be able to model a specific asteroid using all its orbital parameters, subjected to perturbations from other bodies such as :

- the Sun
- Jupiter
- all other planets of the solar system.

We can study the variations of semi-major axis, eccentricity and inclination over a few thousand days.
The current integrator is RungeKutta4.
