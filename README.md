# Asteroid-population
 
School project as part of the CIRI. 

The objective is to modelise the asteroid population and trajectory in the solar system. At the term of the project, we should be able to model a large quantity of asteroids, subjected to perturbations from other bodies such as :

- the sun
- jupiter
- other planets

[Work in progress...]

## Dependencies 
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- PyQt5 (only for the GUI branch)
